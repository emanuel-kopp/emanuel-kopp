# 👋 Hi, I'm Emanuel Kopp

I'm an evolutionary agroecologist with a strong background in plant genetics, ecological modeling, and statistical analysis. I hold a PhD in Ecology from the University of Zurich, where I explored plant cooperation and competition using genomic and phenotypic data.

🔍 I love working at the intersection of ecology, data science, and genetics.  
📊 I specialize in R and Julia, with growing experience in machine learning and genomic analyses.  
🌱 I'm particularly interested in applications of novel concepts and methods to bridge ecology, evolutionary biology and agriculture.

## 🚀 Projects

- [**Labelyst.jl**](https://github.com/emanuel-kopp/labelyst.jl) – A Julia package for generating printable labels (with QR codes and metadata) for experimental setups. Converts a DataFrame into a Typst document and optionally compiles it into a ready-to-print PDF. Designed for flexible use in lab and field settings (e.g. pot labels, adhesive sample tags).
- [**uzh-mnf-phd**](https://github.com/emanuel-kopp/uzh-mnf-phd) – An unofficial Typst template for PhD theses at the University of Zurich’s Faculty of Science.
